                        <p>
                            “Knowledge is power” is a profound saying, it empowers any nation in the world to grow economically, politically and spiritually. At UK Merit Academy, we strongly believe in this truth. That`s why we do our best to equip individuals with the knowledge, values, and skills they need. In this mission, the Thero, his assistants, donors and learners – including you - are all vital contributors. From today, you too are part of this journey.

                            The world is changing rapidly – everything from the way we learn to our very expectations in life is evolving. Staying up to date is no longer a choice; it is a necessity. If you fall behind, the world will move on without you – just like dinosaurs, you could become irrelevant. So, become a citizen rich in wisdom, strength, talent and above all, goodness. Stay updated. Take even step forward – it matters.

                            We live more comfortably today because of great inventions such as the wheel, fire, paper, the light bulb, the telephone, penicillin, the airplane, the internet and now, artificial intelligence. Imagine planting a tree not just for yourself, but for others – and seeing the world benefit from its leaves, shade, and fruit. There is no greater joy. If you are inspired by our work, this effort is for you.

                        “Life`s most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?” - a great quote by Martin Luther King Jr. The answer is simple: become a better person and help others do the same.
